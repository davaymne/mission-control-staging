graphprotocol-infrastructure
========

A monitoring solution for hosting a graph node on a single Docker host with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](http://grafana.org/), [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor),
[NodeExporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) and alerting with [AlertManager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager).

The monitoring configuration adapted the template by the graph team in the [mission control repository](https://github.com/graphprotocol/mission-control-indexer).

The main difference is that it's cheaper. the full deployment on google cloud costs $500 per month while this simple docker compose script can be hosted on any bare metal server with more than 10 cores at about the same performance. The drawdown is that no backups are created.

The data is stored in named volumes on the docker host and can be exported / copied over to a bigger machine once mpore performance is needed.

The minimum competitive configuration I would assume to be the CPX51 VPS at [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=uqph3EQTVIIR). By signing up using my referral link you can save 20€ and I get 10€ bonus for more experiments. 

You will need a achieve node to complete the testnet challenge. For testing purposes I can offer mine but make no guarantees regarding performance.

## Get a domain 

To enable SSL on your host you should get a domain.

You can use any domain and any regsitrar that allowes you to edit DNS records to point subdomains to your IP address.

For a free option go to [dotTK](http://www.dot.tk) and find a free domain name. Create a account and complete the registration. 

Hint: the shop is a bit broken. On the first try to checkout the shopping cart was empty for me, but there is a link to go back to the search results. Click this to go back, put the domain in the shopping cart again, next time it worked.

In the last step choose "use dns" and enter the IP address of your server for 2 subdomains like in the picture. You can choose up to 12 months for free.

![dotTK checkout](/dottk_checkout.png)

Under "Service > My Domains > Manage Domain > Manage Freenom DNS" you can add more subdomains later for e.g. the Grafana dashboard.

## Install

Prerequisites:

* Docker Engine >= 1.13
* Docker Compose >= 1.11

On a fresh Ubuntu server login via ssh and execute the following commands:

```bash
apt update -y
apt install docker.io docker-compose httpie
```

Clone this repository on your Docker host, cd into graphprotocol-infrastructure directory and run compose up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/butterfly-academy/graphprotocol-infrastructure.git
cd graphprotocol-infrastructure

EMAIL=my@email INDEX_HOST=index.mydomain.tk QUERY_HOST=query.mydomain.tk ADMIN_USER=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=change_me ETHEREUM="mainnet:<ETH_RPC_URL>"  ETHEREUM_START_BLOCK=7710671 docker-compose up -d
```

The ADMIN_USER and ADMIN_PASSWORD will be used by Grafana, Prometheus and AlertManager.
QUERY_HOST and INDEX_HOST should point to the subdomains created earlier.

Containers:

* Graph Node (indexer / query node) `http://<host-ip>:8000`
* Postgres Database
* Prometheus (metrics database) `http://<host-ip>:9090`
* Prometheus-Pushgateway (push acceptor for ephemeral and batch jobs) `http://<host-ip>:9091`
* AlertManager (alerts management) `http://<host-ip>:9093`
* Grafana (visualize metrics) `http://<host-ip>:3000`
* NodeExporter (host metrics collector)
* cAdvisor (containers metrics collector)
* Caddy (reverse proxy and basic auth provider for prometheus and alertmanager)

## Indexing Subgraphs

Connect via ssh to the server and issue the following commands to index the subraphs required for phase 0 of the testnet challenge.

```bash
http post 127.0.0.1:8020 jsonrpc="2.0" method="subgraph_create" id="2" params:='{"name": "synthetixio-team/synthetix"}'
http post 127.0.0.1:8020 jsonrpc="2.0" id="2" method="subgraph_deploy" params:='{"name": "synthetixio-team/synthetix", "ipfs_hash": "Qme2hDXrkBpuXAYEuwGPAjr6zwiMZV4FHLLBa3BHzatBWx"}'

http post 127.0.0.1:8020 jsonrpc="2.0" method="subgraph_create" id="2" params:='{"name": "uniswap/uniswap-v2"}'
http post 127.0.0.1:8020 jsonrpc="2.0" id="2" method="subgraph_deploy" params:='{"name": "uniswap/uniswap-v2", "ipfs_hash": "QmXKwSEMirgWVn41nRzkT3hpUBw29cp619Gx58XW6mPhZP"}'

http post 127.0.0.1:8020 jsonrpc="2.0" method="subgraph_create" id="1" params:='{"name": "molochventures/moloch"}'
http post 127.0.0.1:8020 jsonrpc="2.0" id="1" method="subgraph_deploy" params:='{"name": "molochventures/moloch", "ipfs_hash": "QmTXzATwNfgGVukV1fX2T6xw9f6LAYRVWpsdXyRWzUR2H9"}'

http post 127.0.0.1:8020 jsonrpc="2.0" method="subgraph_create" id="4" params:='{"name": "jannis/gravity"}'
http post 127.0.0.1:8020 jsonrpc="2.0" id="4" method="subgraph_deploy" params:='{"name": "jannis/gravity", "ipfs_hash": "QmbeDC4G8iPAUJ6tRBu99vwyYkaSiFwtXWKwwYkoNphV4X"}'
```

## Debugging

In case of problems you can access the log output of each container (e.g. graph-node) with the command

```bash
docker logs <container> --follow --tail 100
```

## Setup Grafana

Navigate to `http://<host-ip>:3000` and login with user ***admin*** password ***admin***. You can change the credentials in the compose file or by supplying the `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables on compose up. The config file can be added directly in grafana part like this
```
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:5.2.4
  env_file:
    - config

```
and the config file format should have this content
```
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
```
If you want to change the password, you have to remove this entry, otherwise the change will not take effect
```
- grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
```

Grafana is preconfigured with dashboards and Prometheus plus Postgres as the default data source:

***Docker Host Dashboard***

![Host](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Docker_Host.png)

The Docker Host Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the resource usage of your server:

* Server uptime, CPU idle percent, number of CPU cores, available memory, swap and storage
* System load average graph, running and blocked by IO processes graph, interrupts graph
* CPU usage graph by mode (guest, idle, iowait, irq, nice, softirq, steal, system, user)
* Memory usage graph by distribution (used, free, buffers, cached)
* IO usage graph (read Bps, read Bps and IO time)
* Network usage graph by device (inbound Bps, Outbound Bps)
* Swap usage and activity graphs

For storage and particularly Free Storage graph, you have to specify the fstype in grafana graph request.
You can find it in `grafana/dashboards/docker_host.json`, at line 480 :

      "expr": "sum(node_filesystem_free_bytes{fstype=\"btrfs\"})",

I work on BTRFS, so i need to change `aufs` to `btrfs`.

You can find right value for your system in Prometheus `http://<host-ip>:9090` launching this request :

      node_filesystem_free_bytes

***Docker Containers Dashboard***

![Containers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Docker_Containers.png)

The Docker Containers Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring running containers:

* Total containers CPU load, memory and storage usage
* Running containers graph, system load graph, IO usage graph
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Container cached memory usage graph
* Container network inbound usage graph
* Container network outbound usage graph

Note that this dashboard doesn't show the containers that are part of the monitoring stack.

***Monitor Services Dashboard***

![Monitor Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Prometheus.png)

The Monitor Services Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the containers that make up the monitoring stack:

* Prometheus container uptime, monitoring stack total memory usage, Prometheus local storage memory chunks and series
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Prometheus chunks to persist and persistence urgency graphs
* Prometheus chunks ops and checkpoint duration graphs
* Prometheus samples ingested rate, target scrapes and scrape duration graphs
* Prometheus HTTP requests graph
* Prometheus alerts graph

## Define alerts

Three alert groups have been setup within the [alert.rules](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules) configuration file:

* Monitoring services alerts [targets](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L2-L11)
* Docker Host alerts [host](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L13-L40)
* Docker Containers alerts [containers](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L42-L69)

You can modify the alert rules and reload them by making a HTTP POST call to Prometheus:

```
curl -X POST http://admin:admin@<host-ip>:9090/-/reload
```

***Monitoring services alerts***

Trigger an alert if any of the monitoring targets (node-exporter and cAdvisor) are down for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: monitor_service_down
    expr: up == 0
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Monitor service non-operational"
      description: "Service {{ $labels.instance }} is down."
```

***Docker Host alerts***

Trigger an alert if the Docker host CPU is under high load for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: high_cpu_load
    expr: node_load1 > 1.5
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server under high load"
      description: "Docker host is under high load, the avg load 1m is at {{ $value}}. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

Modify the load threshold based on your CPU cores.

Trigger an alert if the Docker host memory is almost full:

```yaml
- alert: high_memory_load
    expr: (sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) - sum(node_memory_MemFree_bytes + node_memory_Buffers_bytes + node_memory_Cached_bytes) ) / sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100 > 85
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server memory is almost full"
      description: "Docker host memory usage is {{ humanize $value}}%. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

Trigger an alert if the Docker host storage is almost full:

```yaml
- alert: high_storage_load
    expr: (node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype="aufs"} - node_filesystem_free_bytes{fstype="aufs"}) / node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype="aufs"}  * 100 > 85
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server storage is almost full"
      description: "Docker host storage usage is {{ humanize $value}}%. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

***Docker Containers alerts***

Trigger an alert if a container is down for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_down
    expr: absent(container_memory_usage_bytes{name="jenkins"})
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins down"
      description: "Jenkins container is down for more than 30 seconds."
```

Trigger an alert if a container is using more than 10% of total CPU cores for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_high_cpu
    expr: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{name="jenkins"}[1m])) / count(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system"}) * 100 > 10
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins high CPU usage"
      description: "Jenkins CPU usage is {{ humanize $value}}%."
```

Trigger an alert if a container is using more than 1.2GB of RAM for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_high_memory
    expr: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{name="jenkins"}) > 1200000000
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins high memory usage"
      description: "Jenkins memory consumption is at {{ humanize $value}}."
```

## Setup alerting

The AlertManager service is responsible for handling alerts sent by Prometheus server.
AlertManager can send notifications via email, Pushover, Slack, HipChat or any other system that exposes a webhook interface.
A complete list of integrations can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration).

You can view and silence notifications by accessing `http://<host-ip>:9093`.

The notification receivers can be configured in [alertmanager/config.yml](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/alertmanager/config.yml) file.

To receive alerts via Slack you need to make a custom integration by choose ***incoming web hooks*** in your Slack team app page.
You can find more details on setting up Slack integration [here](http://www.robustperception.io/using-slack-with-the-alertmanager/).

Copy the Slack Webhook URL into the ***api_url*** field and specify a Slack ***channel***.

```yaml
route:
    receiver: 'slack'
    group_by: ['...']

receivers:
    - name: 'slack'
      slack_configs:
          - send_resolved: true
            text: "{{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}"
            username: 'Prometheus'
            channel: '#<channel>'
            api_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/<webhook-id>'
```

![Slack Notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Slack_Notifications.png)


## Using Email for alerting

```yaml
route:
    receiver: 'email'
    group_by: ['...']

receivers:
    - name: 'email'
      email_configs:
          - to: receiver@email.com
            from: my@email.com
            smarthost: mail.server.biz:587
            auth_username: my@email.com
            auth_password: password
            require_tls: true
```

Note: setting up sending alerts from popular services like Gmail is more complicated due to higer security precautions. You need App passwords and stuff. Take it easy and use a small but standard conform provider.


## Sending metrics to the Pushgateway

The [pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) is used to collect data from batch jobs or from services.

To push data, simply execute:

    echo "some_metric 3.14" | curl --data-binary @- http://user:password@localhost:9091/metrics/job/some_job

Please replace the `user:password` part with your user and password set in the initial configuration (default: `admin:admin`).

## Updating Grafana to v5.2.2

[In Grafana versions >= 5.1 the id of the grafana user has been changed](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/docker/#migration-from-a-previous-version-of-the-docker-container-to-5-1-or-later). Unfortunately this means that files created prior to 5.1 won’t have the correct permissions for later versions.

| Version |   User  | User ID |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  < 5.1  | grafana |   104   |
|  \>= 5.1 | grafana |   472   |

There are two possible solutions to this problem.
- Change ownership from 104 to 472
- Start the upgraded container as user 104

##### Specifying a user in docker-compose.yml

To change ownership of the files run your grafana container as root and modify the permissions.

First perform a `docker-compose down` then modify your docker-compose.yml to include the `user: root` option:

```
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:5.2.2
    container_name: grafana
    volumes:
      - grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
      - ./grafana/datasources:/etc/grafana/datasources
      - ./grafana/dashboards:/etc/grafana/dashboards
      - ./grafana/setup.sh:/setup.sh
    entrypoint: /setup.sh
    user: root
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=${ADMIN_USER:-admin}
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}
      - GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - 3000
    networks:
      - monitor-net
    labels:
      org.label-schema.group: "monitoring"
```

Perform a `docker-compose up -d` and then issue the following commands:

```
docker exec -it --user root grafana bash

# in the container you just started:
chown -R root:root /etc/grafana && \
chmod -R a+r /etc/grafana && \
chown -R grafana:grafana /var/lib/grafana && \
chown -R grafana:grafana /usr/share/grafana
```

To run the grafana container as `user: 104` change your `docker-compose.yml` like such:

```
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:5.2.2
    container_name: grafana
    volumes:
      - grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
      - ./grafana/datasources:/etc/grafana/datasources
      - ./grafana/dashboards:/etc/grafana/dashboards
      - ./grafana/setup.sh:/setup.sh
    entrypoint: /setup.sh
    user: "104"
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=${ADMIN_USER:-admin}
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}
      - GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - 3000
    networks:
      - monitor-net
    labels:
      org.label-schema.group: "monitoring"
```
